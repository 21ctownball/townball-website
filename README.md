## Content

This repository also acts as a simple <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> by composing written content (info pages, blogs, etc) with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and game statistics with CSV files.

This allows writers or scorekeepers to contribute to the project directly while reaping the benefits of version control.
